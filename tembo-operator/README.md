# Tembo Operator

The Tembo Operator is a Kubernetes Operator used for creating, updating, and deleting PostgreSQL (Postgres) instances.

The key differentiators of the Tembo Operator are:

- Unique extension management experience
- Concept of Stacks
- Easily integrate Apps to run alongside Postgres

## Quick Start

While it's fairly straightforward to get started running the Tembo Operator locally, there are a number of prerequisite software that you'll need before getting started.
For an exhaustive list, please refer to the project's [contributing guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Cluster Operations

To destroy any existing cluster and start the containers needed for a new one, simply run:

```bash
just start-kind
```

In addition to starting the cluster, a fair number of necessary dependencies are installed by subtasks. Check out the definition in the `justfile` if you're curious, it's all pretty composable.

Once the `kind` cluster has been started, you can start a local copy of the Tembo Operator to use it. Again, it's pretty easy:

```bash
just run
```

## Examples

With the cluster running, you're ready to test some of the built-in features of the Tembo Operator.

### 1. Trying out Postgres extensions

:bulb: The following steps assume you have gone through the [quick start section](#quick-start).

Start by applying a YAML template of your choosing, hosted at [./yaml](./yaml):

```bash
kubectl apply -f yaml/sample-standard.yaml
```

One established, `psql` into the pod.
This will require a password, the instructions of which are outlined in the CONTRIBUTING.md file's [Connect via psql](https://github.com/tembo-io/tembo/blob/main/tembo-operator/CONTRIBUTING.md#4-connect-via-psql) section.

```bash
psql postgres://postgres:$PGPASSWORD@sample-standard.localhost:5432
```

This will allow you to see the enabled extensions with:

```sql
\dx
```

As well as the to-be-enabled extensions that have already been installed:

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_available_extensions;
```

Go ahead an exit Postgres with `\q` and the pod with `ctl-d`.

Now try to `exec` into the pod via:

```bash
kubectl exec -it sample-standard-1 -- /bin/bash
```

As mentioned above, the Tembo Operator comes pre-packaged with added Postgres extension management.
This comes in the form of the [Trunk](https://pgt.dev/) extension registry, which can be used from within the Kubernetes pod.

Try running the following:

```bash
trunk install pgmq
```

:bulb: Note that you can choose to install any extension found within the Trunk registry.

Considering that you should still be in the pod, simply run `psql` and you should find yourself in the Postgres instance.

As before, try running

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_available_extensions WHERE name = 'pgmq'
```

You should see the extension in the results, from which you can run to enable:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION pgmq CASCADE;
```

### 2. Trying out Tembo Stacks

In the above example, we utilize the `sample-standard.yaml` file, but there are others that offer distinct configurations.
Check out the others in the yaml directory.
Here are some select options to apply just as `sample-standard.yaml` was:

- Try out the [Message Queue Stack](https://tembo.io/docs/tembo-stacks/message-queue) with [sample-message-queue.yaml](./yaml/sample-message-queue.yaml).
- Try out the [OLAP Stack](https://tembo.io/docs/tembo-stacks/olap) with [sample-olap.yaml](./yaml/sample-olap.yaml).
- Try out the [MongoAlternative Stack](https://tembo.io/docs/tembo-stacks/mongo-alternative) with [sample-document.yaml](./yaml/sample-document.yaml).

## Observability with OpenTelemetry and Jaeger

[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) is an observability framework that focuses on generation, collection, management, and export of telemetry.
[Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/), on the other hand, is an observability platform with a companion UI that ingests the OpenTelemetry data.
By integrating both into the Tembo Operator, users are able to gain more insights into their operations.

### Setting up

If you haven't already, you can start a local Kubernetes cluster by running the following:

```bash
just start-kind
```

Once complete, simply run:

```bash
just run-telemetry
```

From there, you're all set to visit the below URL and navigate your telemetry:
```
http://localhost:16686
```

## Usage

In either of the run scenarios, your app is listening on port `8080`, and it will observe events.

Try some of:

```sh
kubectl apply -f yaml/sample-coredb.yaml
kubectl delete coredb sample-coredb
kubectl edit coredb sample-coredb # change replicas
```

The reconciler will run and write the status object on every change. You should see results in the logs of the pod, or on the .status object outputs of `kubectl get coredb -o yaml`.

### Webapp output

The sample web server exposes some example metrics and debug information you can inspect with `curl`.

```sh
$ kubectl apply -f yaml/sample-coredb.yaml
$ curl 0.0.0.0:8080/metrics
# HELP cdb_controller_reconcile_duration_seconds The duration of reconcile to complete in seconds
# TYPE cdb_controller_reconcile_duration_seconds histogram

cdb_controller_reconcile_duration_seconds_sum 0.013

# HELP cdb_controller_reconciliation_errors_total reconciliation errors
# TYPE cdb_controller_reconciliation_errors_total counter

# TYPE cdb_controller_reconciliations_total counter
cdb_controller_reconciliations_total 1
$ curl 0.0.0.0:8080/
{"last_event":"2019-07-17T22:31:37.591320068Z"}
```

The metrics will be auto-scraped if you have a standard [`PodMonitor` for `prometheus.io/scrape`](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/blob/b69e89e73326e8b504102a75d668dc4351fcdb78/charts/prometheus/values.yaml#L1608-L1650).

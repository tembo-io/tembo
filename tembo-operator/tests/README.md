# Integration tests

[Test Organization](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch11-03-test-organization.html)

> In Rust, integration tests are entirely external to your library. They use your library in the same way any other code would, which means they can only call functions that are part of your libraryâ€™s public API. Their purpose is to test whether many parts of your library work together correctly. Units of code that work correctly on their own could have problems when integrated, so test coverage of the integrated code is important as well. To create integration tests, you first need a tests directory.

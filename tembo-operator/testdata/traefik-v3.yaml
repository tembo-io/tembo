                                  FlushInterval defines the interval, in milliseconds, in between flushes to the client while copying the response body.

                                  This configuration is ignored when ReverseProxy recognizes a response as a streaming response;
                                  for such responses, writes are flushed to the client immediately.

                            whether the LB's children are directly the pods IPs or if the only child is the Kubernetes Service clusterIP.
                            The Kubernetes Service itself does load-balance to the pods.
                            By default, NativeLB is false.

                                FlushInterval defines the interval, in milliseconds, in between flushes to the client while copying the response body.
                                A negative value means to flush immediately after each write to the client.
                                This configuration is ignored when ReverseProxy recognizes a response as a streaming response;
                                for such responses, writes are flushed to the client immediately.

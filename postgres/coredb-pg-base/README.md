# Postgres Docker Base Image

Contains a Dockerfile with Postgres 15.3, no extensions and no additional tools.

## Versioning

The version of the Docker image can be configured in the `Cargo.toml` file in this directory. We may wrap postgres in our CoreDB distribution, but for the time being this crate is just a placeholder to allow for versioning.

Tembo aims to improve the experience developers have with deploying, managing, and scaling Postgres. Tembo is under active development that you are free to use anything that we have open-sourced.

## Why Postgres?

Postgres is the best OSS database in the world, with millions of active deployments, and is growing faster than MySQL. It is battle-tested with a large community that can handle SQL (relational) and JSON (non-relational) queries and a widerange of workloads (i.e, analytical, time-series, geospatial, etc), on account of its’ rich ecosystem of add-ons and extensions.

CoreDB aims to dramatically simplify the developer experience of deploying, managing, and scaling
Postgres through a novel “database-as-code” approach.

CoreDB is an "For Everything" distribution of Postgres under active development that you are free to use,
except to compete with the managed service that we are building concurrently with this open project
(see http://coredb.io/coredb-community-license).

The key idea behind CoreDB is to build a radically simplified Postgres platform designed for the
application developer and built to be extensible—removing the friction from the database management
workflow by putting the developer first. Developers will be able to deploy a workload-optimized
Postgres cluster in minutes, with access to all the powerful functionality managed in code, with
the ability to leverage the rich Postgres ecosystem of plugins, extensions, and support.


## Why Postgres?

Postgres is the second most popular database in the world, behind MySQL. It is a battle-tested database
with a large community that can handle SQL (relational) and JSON (non-relational) queries and a wide
range of workloads (i.e, analytical, time-series, geospatial, etc), on account of its’ rich ecosystem
of add-ons and extensions.

## Deploying

Deploying and managing a Postgres database is complex. There are numerous configurations and optimization
options. Backup and disaster recovery are non-trivial. Significant resources are required to deploy in
distributed and highly available modes. These deployments are primarily managed by DBAs (database
administrators) and data engineers, who spend most of their time optimizing queries, indexes, table
structures, building new data models, and optimizing the underlying hardware. Application developers
in larger teams rely on DBAs and data engineers to provision, configure, and manage their Postgres
databases for their applications.

## Schema Management

In addition to the operational complexity of running the database infrastructure, there is a lack of
good development interfaces to manage the lifecycle of the data model itself. As a simple example,
what should happen if you want to change the type of a field in the database? Application developers
currently have to rely on custom libraries/tooling/process to solve this problem.

## Features

* None yet :)

## Roadmap - MVP

* CLI Ops — changes to the cluster, database, and schemas are documented in code, and stored in source control
* Beautiful monitoring UI — get information about the cluster, without having to use the SQL console
* Integrated extensions — developers don't have to enable functionality via SQL commands
* Kubernetes Operator

## Roadmap - Next

* Awesome migrations — migrations are a database concern, not an application concern
* Schema source-of-truth — the database should communicate it's schema clearly to authorized users

## Roadmap - Maybe

* Serverless - seperate the storage from the compute
* HTAP - automatically store data in the best format (row-wise or columnar) for the queries that you run
* Multi-master — we should be able to run multiple masters that sync in the background
* App sidecars - standard directories like `/dbt` `/python` `/rust` that you could drop your data pipelines or apps into, and are then run "as close as possible" to the database

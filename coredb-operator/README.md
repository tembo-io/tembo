# CoreDB Operator

A Rust-based Kubernetes Controller for a [`CoreDB Resource`](https://github.com/CoreDB-io/coredb/blob/main/coredb-operator/charts/coredb-operator/templates/crd.yaml) using [kube-rs](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/).

The `Controller` object reconciles `CoreDB` Instances when changes to it are detected, writes to its .status object, creates associated events, and uses finalizers for guaranteed delete handling.

## Requirements

- A Kubernetes cluster: [kind](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind)
- [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- [just](https://github.com/casey/just)
- Opentelemetry collector (**optional**)

### Rust Linting

Run linting with `cargo fmt` and `clippy`

Clippy:

```bash
rustup component add clippy
cargo clippy
```

cargo fmt:

```bash
rustup toolchain install nightly
rustup component add rustfmt --toolchain nightly
cargo +nightly fmt
```

### Running

To build and run the operator locally

```bash
just start-kind
just run
```

- Or, you can run with auto reloading your local changes.
- First, install cargo-watch

```bash
cargo install cargo-watch
```

- Then, run with auto reload

```bash
just watch
```

### Testing

#### Unit testing

```bash
just test
```

#### Integration testing

To automatically set up a local cluster for functional testing, use this script.
This will start a local kind cluster, annotate the `default` namespace for testing
and install the CRD definition.

```bash
just start-kind
```

Or, you can follow the below steps.

- Connect to a cluster that is safe to run the tests against
- Set your kubecontext to any namespace, and label it to indicate it is safe to run tests against this cluster (do not do against non-test clusters)

```bash
NAMESPACE=<namespace> just annotate
```

- Start or install the controller you want to test (see the following sections)
- Run the integration tests

```bash
cargo test -- --ignored
```

- The integration tests assume you already have installed or are running the operator connected to the cluster.

#### Other testing notes

- Include the `--nocapture` flag to show print statements during test runs

### Cluster

As an example; install [`kind`](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation). Once installed, follow [these instructions](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/local-registry/) to create a kind cluster connected to a local image registry.

### CRD

Apply the CRD from [cached file](charts/coredb-operator/templates/crd.yaml), or pipe it from `crdgen` (best if changing it):

```sh
just install-crd
```

### OpenTelemetry (TDB)

Setup an OpenTelemetry Collector in your cluster. [Tempo](https://github.com/grafana/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/tempo) / [opentelemetry-operator](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-helm-charts/tree/main/charts/opentelemetry-operator) / [grafana agent](https://github.com/grafana/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/agent-operator) should all work out of the box. If your collector does not support grpc otlp you need to change the exporter in [`main.rs`](./src/main.rs).

## Running

### Locally

```sh
cargo run
```


- Or, with optional telemetry (change as per requirements):

```sh
OPENTELEMETRY_ENDPOINT_URL=https://0.0.0.0:55680 RUST_LOG=info,kube=trace,controller=debug cargo run --features=telemetry
```

### In-cluster

Compile the controller with:

```sh
just compile
```

Build an image with:

```sh
just build
```

Push the image to your local registry with:

```sh
docker push localhost:5001/controller:<tag>
```

Edit the [deployment](./yaml/deployment.yaml)'s image tag appropriately, then run:

```sh
kubectl apply -f yaml/deployment.yaml
kubectl port-forward service/coredb-controller 8080:80
```

**NB**: namespace is assumed to be `default`. If you need a different namespace, you can replace `default` with whatever you want in the yaml and set the namespace in your current-context to get all the commands here to work.

## Usage

In either of the run scenarios, your app is listening on port `8080`, and it will observe `CoreDB` events.

Try some of:

```sh
kubectl apply -f yaml/sample-coredb.yaml
kubectl delete coredb sample-coredb
kubectl edit coredb sample-coredb # change replicas
```

The reconciler will run and write the status object on every change. You should see results in the logs of the pod, or on the .status object outputs of `kubectl get coredb -o yaml`.

### Webapp output

The sample web server exposes some example metrics and debug information you can inspect with `curl`.

```sh
$ kubectl apply -f yaml/sample-coredb.yaml
$ curl 0.0.0.0:8080/metrics
# HELP cdb_controller_reconcile_duration_seconds The duration of reconcile to complete in seconds
# TYPE cdb_controller_reconcile_duration_seconds histogram
cdb_controller_reconcile_duration_seconds_bucket{le="0.01"} 1
cdb_controller_reconcile_duration_seconds_bucket{le="0.1"} 1
cdb_controller_reconcile_duration_seconds_bucket{le="0.25"} 1
cdb_controller_reconcile_duration_seconds_bucket{le="0.5"} 1
cdb_controller_reconcile_duration_seconds_bucket{le="1"} 1
cdb_controller_reconcile_duration_seconds_bucket{le="5"} 1
cdb_controller_reconcile_duration_seconds_bucket{le="15"} 1
cdb_controller_reconcile_duration_seconds_bucket{le="60"} 1
cdb_controller_reconcile_duration_seconds_bucket{le="+Inf"} 1
cdb_controller_reconcile_duration_seconds_sum 0.013
cdb_controller_reconcile_duration_seconds_count 1
# HELP cdb_controller_reconciliation_errors_total reconciliation errors
# TYPE cdb_controller_reconciliation_errors_total counter
cdb_controller_reconciliation_errors_total 0
# HELP cdb_controller_reconciliations_total reconciliations
# TYPE cdb_controller_reconciliations_total counter
cdb_controller_reconciliations_total 1
$ curl 0.0.0.0:8080/
{"last_event":"2019-07-17T22:31:37.591320068Z"}
```

The metrics will be auto-scraped if you have a standard [`PodMonitor` for `prometheus.io/scrape`](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/blob/b69e89e73326e8b504102a75d668dc4351fcdb78/charts/prometheus/values.yaml#L1608-L1650).

## Development

Updating the CRD:

- Edit the [CoreDBSpec struct](./src/controller.rs) as needed.

- `> just generate-crd`
